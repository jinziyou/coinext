# Coinext

> 多资产、面向场所无关（venue-agnostic）的量化研究与执行平台 —— **Rust 热路径 + Python 控制平面**，
> 以「回测↔实盘一致性（backtest↔live parity）」为唯一核心不变量。

A multi-asset, venue-agnostic quantitative trading **research & execution** platform. The hot path
(market-data ingestion + order execution) is **Rust 1.95 on Tokio**; the control plane (strategy
authoring, research, analytics, ops) is **Python 3.13**. They are bridged **only** by PyO3/maturin.

The whole design turns on one invariant — **backtest↔live parity**:

> ONE Strategy API, ONE set of engines (Data / Execution / Risk / Portfolio), ONE deterministic
> synchronous core loop. Only the **Kernel** swaps three things between Backtest / Sandbox / Live:
> the **Clock** (`HistoricalClock` vs `LiveClock`), the **Cache** contents, and the
> **Data/Execution clients** behind identical ports. Every design conflict is tie-broken in favor
> of parity.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design and rationale.

## Status

This is a **scaffold**: the full monorepo is laid out, the shared contracts are defined once in
Rust and mirrored to Python, and a vertical slice runs **end-to-end in pure Rust** today.

| Hexagonal ports (Data/Exec/Strategy/Risk/Portfolio/Bus traits + value types) | `coinext-ports` | ✅ implemented |
| In-memory store | `coinext-cache` | ✅ implemented |

| Pre-trade risk gate + kill-switch | `coinext-risk-engine` | ✅ implemented |
| Portfolio analytics (PnL, exposure, linear/inverse perps) | `coinext-portfolio` | ✅ implemented |
| Data + execution engines (OMS, FSM driver, report folding) | `coinext-data-engine`, `coinext-exec-engine` | ✅ implemented |
| **Simulated exchange** (BrokerageModel: OHLC limit matching, volume-participation partial fills, range-scaled market slippage; DelayedEventQueue) | `coinext-sim` | ✅ implemented + tested |
| **Backtest kernel** (deterministic synchronous core loop) | `coinext-kernel` | ✅ implemented + tested |
| Runnable SMA-crossover backtest | `examples/backtest-sma` | ✅ runs |
| PyO3 bridge (Python `Strategy` → same Rust kernel; OHLC + multi-instrument; parity proof) | `coinext-py` | ✅ implemented + tested |
| Research control plane (backtest, data lake, parity gate) | `python/coinext_{backtest,data,parity}` | ✅ implemented + tested |
| Analytics (trade stats, bias screens, tear sheet + plots) | `python/coinext_analytics` | ✅ implemented + tested |
| Walk-forward optimization (rolling/anchored, OOS degradation, grid/Optuna) | `python/coinext_optimize` | ✅ implemented + tested |
| Binance adapter, network, persistence, ingest/exec services | `coinext-adapters/*`, `coinext-network`, … | 🚧 interface stubs |
| FastAPI control plane + React dashboard + docker-compose + observability | `services/*`, `deploy/*` | 🚧 scaffolded |

## Quick start (Rust core)

```bash
# Run the unit + property tests across the core workspace
cargo test

# Run the example SMA-crossover backtest end-to-end
cargo run -p coinext-example-backtest
```

Expected output is a tear-sheet-style summary (orders, fills, equity, return, Sharpe, max drawdown)
produced by running a native-Rust `Strategy` through the SimulatedExecutionClient with realistic
fees, slippage, and **delayed fills interleaved on the time-frontier** — the same `Strategy` trait a
Python strategy implements and the same path that runs live.

## Quick start (research: real data, reproducible backtests)

The Python control plane downloads REAL Binance history (public REST, no API key) into a local
**Parquet data lake**, then backtests over the SAME bytes repeatedly — reproducible research.

```bash
# Build the Rust core into the venv (once), then download + backtest from the lake
just py-build
uv run coinext download --symbols BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT --interval 1m --days 30   # paginated -> Parquet lake
uv run coinext catalog                                                      # coverage (rows + UTC span)
uv run coinext backtest --from-lake --symbol BTCUSDT                        # reproducible SMA backtest
uv run coinext optimize --from-lake --mode anchored                        # walk-forward, OOS degradation
```

The `backtest` tear sheet reports trade-level stats (win rate, profit factor, exposure, turnover)
and runs the look-ahead / overfitting **bias screens** inline. `optimize` does a genuine
walk-forward — params are chosen IN-SAMPLE per fold and re-scored OUT-of-sample, so its headline is
the **OOS degradation** that guards against overfitting (grid search by default; `--optuna` for TPE).

```bash
uv run coinext backtest --strategy limit-maker          # rests LIMIT orders -> OHLC-aware (high/low) fills
```

`--strategy limit-maker` posts resting limit orders that fill on a bar's **intrabar high/low**, not
just its close — the bridge passes full OHLC to the Rust sim, so a limit fills on a wick its close
never reached (a close-only series would miss it). The same path serves real OHLC via `--from-lake`.

```bash
uv run coinext backtest-multi --symbols BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT,SOLUSDT     # a portfolio through ONE kernel
uv run coinext screen --from-lake --symbol BTCUSDT                  # fast vectorized sweep + cross-check
```

`screen` ranks a parameter grid in milliseconds with a **vectorized** (numpy) backtest — fast but
NON-authoritative (no fees/slippage/latency/queue) — then runs `coinext_parity.cross_check` to warn if the
best params **drift** from the event-driven runner. Narrow the space with `screen`, then confirm
survivors with the parity-valid `coinext backtest`.

The end-to-end research loop (screen → optimize → backtest → indicators → portfolio → ticks) is a
single runnable script: `uv run python notebooks/research_loop.py` (synthetic by default; flip
`USE_LAKE = True` to run over the real lake).

`backtest-multi` runs a per-symbol SMA portfolio across many instruments in a single deterministic
kernel (shared Cache / sim / risk / portfolio). The strategy reads `bar.symbol` and targets orders
with `ctx.submit_market(side, qty, symbol)`; positions stay isolated per instrument, and a portfolio
run is exactly the union of the per-symbol standalone runs (see `tests/test_multi_instrument.py`).

The downloader pages past Binance's 1000-bar request limit; the lake is partitioned
(`bars/venue=…/symbol=…/interval=…/{YYYYMM}.parquet`) and deduped/idempotent, so re-downloads only
extend coverage. `HistoryReader` reads it back for the backtest (and, in live, for indicator
warm-up — the ONE history path that keeps indicators identical across backtest and live).
